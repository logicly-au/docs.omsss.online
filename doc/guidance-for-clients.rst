Guidance on Information for clients
====================================

It is essential that clients are told about the reasons for the request and
who the information is being requested by prior to receiving a request to
complete an outcome measure through the OMSSS. When a collection is requested
through the PMHC MDS, or a client email or SMS is provided to OMSSS when
using the OMSSS API, the following wording will be used in the invitation
that is sent to the client. Where a client email or SMS is not provided via
the OMSSS API, the Department suggests the wording below as a basis for PHNs
to use, or promote to commissioned providers to use, in informing clients.
PHNs and service providers may vary the wording to suit their requirements,
or embed them in existing client information documents they have prepared
locally. The wording differs slightly depending on whether the measure
selected is to be completed by the client about themselves (the K10+ and
K5, SDQ for youth) or whether it completed by parents/guardians in respect
of children under their care (SDQ for children).
