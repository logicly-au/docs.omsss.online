Privacy information for clients completing the K-10, K-5 or SDQ youth version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of receiving services, you will be invited to complete a brief questionnaire about
aspects of your current mental wellbeing. The information you provide will be used by your
health practitioner to better understand your situation and inform the discussions you have
with them about your needs. You might be asked to complete the questionnaire at various
times throughout the care that you receive. This will help you and your health practitioner to
monitor progress and adjust your treatment to best meet your needs.

You may receive these invitations by email or SMS message from your
service provider. You can complete the questionnaire in your own time and on your own
device (e.g., tablet, home computer, smart phone). In some cases, you may be invited to
complete the questionnaire on a device at your health practitioner’s work place.

It is up to you whether to complete the questionnaire but you are encouraged to do so. The
information you provide goes directly to your health practitioner. Along with other information
collected during your treatment, the data are kept in your clinical record maintained by your health
practitioner. Some of that data may be provided on an anonymous basis to the Primary Health
Network that is paying your health practitioner for the services you receive, and to the
Australian Government Department of Health. But that only occurs if you have given your
consent to allowing de-identified information to be provided to the PHN and Department.
Your health practitioner can advise you further about the consent process and how your privacy
is protected under the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988.
