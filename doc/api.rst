OMSSS API
=========

The OMSSS API allows third parties to embed the OMSSS measure collection
cycle within their own systems and business processes. A request may be
generated for a client to complete a specific measure. Communication of that
request can be by sharing a link, a QR code, email, and/or text message.
More information is available at the `API endpoint <https://api.omsss.online/>`_.
