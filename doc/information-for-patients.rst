Guidance on Information for Patients
====================================

It is essential that clients are told in advance of receiving a request to complete an outcome
measure through the OMSSS process about the reasons for the request and who the
information is being requested by. The wording below is suggested as a basis for PHNs to
use, or promote to commissioned providers to use, in informing clients. PHNs and service
providers may vary the wording to suit their requirements, or embed them in existing client
information documents that they have prepared locally. The wording differs slightly
depending on whether the measure selected is to be completed by the client about
themselves (the K10 and K5, SDQ for youth) or whether it completed by parents/guardians
in respect of children under their care (SDQ for children).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*As part of receiving services, you will be invited to complete a brief questionnaire about
aspects of your current mental wellbeing. The information you provide will be used by your
service provider to better understand your situation and inform the discussions you have
with them about your needs. You might be asked to complete the questionnaire at various
times throughout the care that you receive. This will help you and your service provider to
monitor progress and adjust your treatment to best meet your needs.*

*You may receive these invitations by email or SMS message from your
service provider. You can complete the questionnaire in your own time and on your own
device (e.g., tablet, home computer, smart phone). In some cases, you may be invited to
complete the questionnaire on a device at your service providerâ€™s work place.*

*It is up to you whether to complete the questionnaire but you are encouraged to do so. The
information you provide goes directly to your service provider. Along with other information
collected during your treatment, the data are kept in your clinical record kept by your service
provider. Some of that data may be provided on an anonymous basis to the Primary Health
Network that is paying your service provider for the services you receive, and to the
Australian Government Department of Health. But that only occurs if you have given your
consent to allowing de-identified information to be provided to the PHN and Department.
Your service provider can advise you further about the consent process and how your privacy
is protected under the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988.*
