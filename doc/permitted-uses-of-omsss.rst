Permitted uses of OMSSS
-----------------------

Primary Health Networks (PHNs) and their commissioned Provider Organisations
can use the OMSSS to collect the mandated outcome measures free of charge
when the data is being collected as part of the PMHC MDS.

At this stage, no other use of the OMSSS is permitted. A wider application of
OMSSS in primary mental health care may be considered in the future.

**The Department is aware of a range of proprietary client information
management systems in use by private practising providers and organisations in
Australia.  Any licensing agreement for use of the SDQ within these systems
for purposes other than PMHC MDS collection and reporting is a matter that must
be separately negotiated between the software owners and Youth In Mind.
Additionally, the Department is aware that many individual Australian mental
health practitioners make use of the functionality offered by Youth In Mind,
including MySDQ, SDQPlus and SDQScore. Responsibility for ensuring compliance
with Youth In Mind requirements for each of these functions rests with the
individual practitioners and their parent organisations.**
