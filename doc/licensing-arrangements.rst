Licensing arrangements and permitted use
========================================

PHNs and their commissioned Provider Organisations can use the OMSSS to
collect the mandated measures free of charge when the service provided
to the client has been commissioned by the relevant PHN.

At this stage, no other use of the OMSSS is permitted. A wider application of
OMSSS in primary mental health care may be considered in the future.

K10+ and K5
-----------

Both the K10+ and K5 measures are in the public domain and may be used freely.
Each of these measures is used widely throughout Australia with no restrictions
on their incorporation in electronic data collection systems.

SDQ
---

The SDQ measures, authored by Dr Robert Goodman, are copyright protected with
the UK-based Youthinmind organisation (https://youthinmind.com/).
Specific conditions are attached to use of the SDQ measures, detailed at https://sdqinfo.org/.
These include the requirement that no modifications are made to the content in
any way. Paper versions may be downloaded and copied without charge, subject
to adherence to this condition.

The Australian Government Department of Health has entered into a licence
agreement with Youthinmind to enable inclusion of the SDQ measures within the
OMSSS.  This enables PHNs and commissioned providers to use the electronic data
collection, scoring and upload arrangements but **only in the context of delivery
of mental health care to services that have been commissioned by PHNs**.
Further details in relation to licensed uses are described below.

The department is aware of a range of proprietary CIMS
in use by private practising providers and organisations in Australia.
Any licensing agreement for use of the SDQ within these systems for purposes other
than PMHC MDS collection and reporting is a matter that must be separately
negotiated between the software owners and Youthinmind. Additionally, the
department is aware that many individual Australian mental health practitioners
make use of the functionality offered by Youthinmind, including MySDQ, SDQPlus
and SDQScore. Responsibility for ensuring compliance with Youthinmind
requirements for each of these functions rests with the individual practitioners
and their parent organisations.

YES PHN
-------

The YES PHN survey has now been included into the PMHC MDS data model and
into the OMSSS. YES PHN data is not linked to client or episode records to
adhere with the protocol for use and implementation of the YES PHN survey
outlined in the guidance (available at https://www.amhocn.org/your-experience-service-surveys).
This includes assurance to the client that the results are anonymous and
administering organisations will not be able to identify both if their client
has completed a YES PHN survey, or their scores.
