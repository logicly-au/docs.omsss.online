Outcome measures licensing arrangements
---------------------------------------

Both the K10+ and K5 measures are in the public domain and may be used freely.
Each of these measures is used widely throughout Australia with no restrictions
on their incorporation in electronic data collection systems.

In contrast, the SDQ measures are copyright protected with copyright held by
Robert Goodman of the UK-based Youth in Mind organisation (https://youthinmind.com/).
Specific conditions are attached to use of the SDQ measures, detailed at https://sdqinfo.org/.
These include the requirement that no modifications are made to the content in
any way. Paper versions may be downloaded and copied without charge subject
to adherence to this condition.

While the downloaded paper forms may be downloaded and completed/scored manually,
Youth In Mind offers a commercial automated scoring service that requires
users to register and pay on a per-use basis. Strict conditions are imposed to
prevent users from creating or distributing electronic versions of the SDQ
measures without specific agreement by Youth In Mind.

The Australian Government Department of Health has entered into a licence
agreement with Youth in Mind to enable inclusion of the SDQ measures within the
OMSSS.  This enables PHNs and commissioned providers to use the electronic data
collection, scoring and upload arrangements but **only in the context of delivery
of mental health care to services that have been commissioned by PHNs**.
Further details in relation to licensed uses are described below.
