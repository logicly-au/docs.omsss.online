Licensing arrangements and permitted use
========================================

Primary Health Networks (PHNs) and their commissioned Provider Organisations can use
the OMSSS to collect the mandated measures free of charge when the data is
being collected as part of the PMHC MDS.

At this stage, no other use of the OMSSS is permitted. A wider application of
OMSSS in primary mental health care may be considered in the future.

K10+ and K5
-----------

Both the K10+ and K5 measures are in the public domain and may be used freely
as long as the author is properly referenced. Each of these measures is used
widely throughout Australia with no restrictions on their incorporation in
electronic data collection systems.

SDQ
---

The SDQ measures are copyright protected with copyright held by
Robert Goodman of the UK-based Youthinmind organisation (https://youthinmind.com/).
Specific conditions are attached to use of the SDQ measures, detailed at https://sdqinfo.org/.
These include the requirement that no modifications are made to the content in
any way. Paper versions may be downloaded and copied without charge subject
to adherence to this condition.

While the paper forms may be downloaded and completed/scored manually,
Youth In Mind offers a commercial automated scoring service that requires
users to register and pay on a per-use basis. Strict conditions are imposed to
prevent users from creating or distributing electronic versions of the SDQ
measures without specific agreement by Youthinmind.

The Australian Government Department of Health has entered into a licence
agreement with Youthinmind to enable inclusion of the SDQ measures within the
OMSSS.  This enables PHNs and commissioned providers to use the electronic data
collection, scoring and upload arrangements but **only in the context of delivery
of mental health care to services that have been commissioned by PHNs**.
Further details in relation to licensed uses are described below.

The Department is aware of a range of proprietary client information management
systems in use by private practising providers and organisations in Australia.
Any licensing agreement for use of the SDQ within these systems for purposes other
than PMHC MDS collection and reporting is a matter that must be separately
negotiated between the software owners and Youthinmind. Additionally, the
Department is aware that many individual Australian mental health practitioners
make use of the functionality offered by Youthinmind, including MySDQ, SDQPlus
and SDQScore. Responsibility for ensuring compliance with Youthinmind
requirements for each of these functions rests with the individual practitioners
and their parent organisations.
