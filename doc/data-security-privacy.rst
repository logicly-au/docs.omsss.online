Data Security and Privacy
=========================

Client privacy is important and is the responsibility of PHNs, service providers,
and the Department of Health to ensure that all client information is managed
appropriately and in accordance with respective obligations under legislation
and the Australian Privacy Principles. Personal information of clients, and
the results of their  measures will be sent only to their health care provider.
All entered data is communicated and stored in compliance with Australian
privacy and data security legislation. This includes encrypting all information
in transit and ensuring that only appropriate and approved people have access
to that information.

The collection of client measures through the OMSSS as implemented by the
PMHC MDS complies with the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 and
the Australian Privacy Principles. Organisations utilising the OMSSS API to
collect measures directly are responsible for ensuring appropriate legislative
requirements are complied with.

The OMSSS system has been designed so that it does not need to store any
information that can identify the client. The only required information
associated with the measure data is a unique number, which is
automatically generated by the OMSSS system. This number is returned to the
integrator’s system, which is then associated with the client’s record.

Information is stored in OMSSS only while it is in use, and for a limited
amount of time. Collection data can only be submitted for up to 7 days after
the record has been created, and after a collection has been submitted,
results are only stored for a maximum of 7 days. All data except logs are
automatically deleted after a period of 7 days, and can also be deleted
earlier at the request of the integrator. Results pertaining to deleted
data will be inaccessible after deletion, and the retained logs do not
contain any personally identifying information.

The integrator can provide additional information to OMSSS when the measure
is created. OMSSS stores this information and will pass it back to the
integrator when the collection is retrieved. The purpose of using this
option to provide additional information is to assist the integrator in
matching the measure with the client’s data.

It is optional to enter additional information as outlined above.  In cases
where a health care provider’s CIMS is integrated with OMSSS, the integrator
determines whether additional detail should be provided, and if so, what.
