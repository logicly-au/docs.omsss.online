Data Security and Privacy
=========================

We recognise the importance of maintaining the client’s privacy and acknowledge
our responsibility to manage this effectively. All entered data is communicated
and stored in compliance with Australian privacy and data security legislation.
This includes encrypting all information in transit and ensuring that only
appropriate and approved people have access to that information.

The OMSSS system has been designed so that it does not need to store any
information that can identify the client. The only required information
associated with the outcome measure data is a unique number, which is
automatically generated by the OMSSS system. This number is returned to the
integrator’s system, which is then associated with the client’s record.

Information is stored in OMSSS only while it is in use, and for a limited
amount of time. Collection data can only be submitted for up to 7 days after
the record has been created, and after a collection has been submitted,
results are only stored for a maximum of 7 days. All data except logs are
automatically deleted after a period of 7 days, and can also be deleted
earlier at the request of the integrator. Results pertaining to deleted
data will be inaccessible after deletion, and the retained logs do not
contain any personally identifying information.

The integrator can provide additional information to OMSSS when the measure
is created. OMSSS stores this information and will pass it back to the
integrator when the collection is retrieved. The purpose of using this
option to provide additional information is to assist the integrator in
matching the outcome measure with the client’s data.

It is optional to enter additional information as outlined above.  In cases
where a health care provider’s CIMS is integrated with OMSSS, the integrator
determines whether additional detail should be provided, and if so, what.
