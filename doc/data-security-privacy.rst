Data Security and Privacy
=========================

We recognise the importance of maintaining the client's privacy and acknowledge our
responsibility to manage this effectively. All entered data is communicated and stored in
compliance with Australian privacy and data security legislation.

The OMSSS system has been designed so that it does not need to store any information
that can identify the client. The only data that is associated with the
outcome measure data is a unique number that is generated by the OMSSS system.
This number is returned to the integrator's system and the integrator then associates
that number with the client in the integrator's system. Therefore, when used in the
context of the PMHC MDS no identifying information is stored in OMSSS.

Data is not stored long term in OMSSS. You can only submit a collection for up
to 7 days after it is created. Once a collection is submitted the results are stored
until the integrator retrieves them up to a maximum of 7 days. After 7 days the data
will be deleted and the integrator will no longer be able to retrieve the results.
Once any of the above expiry times have been hit, all data except logs are deleted.

The client's personal information and the results of their outcome measures will
be sent only to their health care provider and stored in the PMHC MDS either
directly or via the health care provider’s CIMS. Once the data is stored in
the PMHC MDS it’s use is fully subject to the same
`client consent <https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/data-model-and-specifications.html#episode-client-consent-to-anonymised-data>`_ as any
other data stored in the PMHC MDS.
