Data Security and Privacy
=========================

We recognise the importance of maintaining the client's privacy and acknowledge
our responsibility to manage this effectively. All entered data is communicated
and stored in compliance with Australian privacy and data security legislation.
This includes encrypting all information in transit and ensuring that only
appropriate and approved people have access to that information.

The OMSSS system has been designed so that it does not need to store any
information that can identify the client. The only required data that is
associated with the outcome measure data is a unique number that is generated
by the OMSSS system. This number is returned to the integrator's system and the
integrator then associates that number with the client in the integrator's
system. Therefore, when used in the context of the PMHC MDS no identifying
information is stored in OMSSS.

Data is not stored long term in OMSSS. The system is designed such that the
data is only held while in use and is time limited. You can only submit a
collection for up to 7 days after it is created. Once a collection is submitted
the results are stored until the integrator retrieves them up to a maximum of 7
days. After 7 days the data will be deleted and the integrator will no longer
be able to retrieve the results. Once any of the above expiry times have been
hit, all data except logs are deleted. The logs do not contain personally
identifying information.

TODO: clarify what is collected below. Maybe separate out the use cases?
TODO: AC says: I don't actually know what is sent and stored in the PMHC case.
TODO: In the CIMS case it is up the them.

The client's information and the results of their outcome measures may
be sent only to their health care provider and stored in the PMHC MDS either
directly or via the health care provider’s CIMS. Once the data is stored in
the PMHC MDS it’s use is fully subject to the same
`client consent <https://docs.pmhc-mds.com/projects/data-specification/en/v2/data-model-and-specifications.html#episode-client-consent-to-anonymised-data>`_ as any
other data stored in the PMHC MDS.
